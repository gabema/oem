# OEM

OEM is a web component framework that allows you to quickly create and manage your own web component library using native html, css and javascript.

OEM web components are not to be confused with [W3C Web Components](https://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/). OEM defines it's own component architecture using a Spoke-hub distribution model to enable aggregation and compositional patterns between components.

## Quick pitch
The promise of OEM is that the web components you make today will work tomorrow. It does this by providing a platform that makes component-to-component communication the primary focus. Should you reach a point where you decide you no longer want/need OEM, you are left with well abstracted code and functionally that is semantic, native and has little to do with OEM itself.

## Setup

    git clone [repo]
    npm install

<a name="how-it-works"></a>
## How It Works
Oem has two parts: `core` and `components`. The Core *is* the OEM framework while the `components` are the web components that you create and manage. All components and their lifecycles are managed client side by a globally available namespace of `oem`. See `Client Side API` for details. 

OEM also provides a command line utility that streamlines a "conventional" workflow. It relies on the `package.json` file to manage configurations for development, deployment and the creation and destruction of components. The command line utility can be lauched with `node oem`. See the `Command Line API` for details.

### Command Line API
OEM's command line utility facilitates basic workflows for creating, developing and deploying components. The cli can be reached via `node oem [command]`. Each command run's a corresponding script in the `./cli` folder.

### Client Side API
OEM's final artifact is a single javascript file. That includes all js, css, images, etc. Each component has an individual markup structure and implements various abilities exposed by the core as well as their own unique functionality. All components and code are protected under the `oem` namespace. Open up the console in your browser and type in `oem`. All component lifecycle management and core functionality for oem can be controlled programmatically via the namespace.

See `./src/core/Oem.js` for full api implementation details (don't worry, it's simple!).

## Development
The development lifecycle centers around the `node oem dev [component]` command line tool. It launches an express server that loads all files in the component's development configuration registered to the `./package.json` file. Javascript files are automatically included as script tags to the head of the document. This enables the tried and true classic dev process of writing code and checking your work in the browser â€“ old school. It's fast, simple, reliable and will work for the forseeable future.

<a name="deployment"></a>
## Deployment
Each deployment entry is a configuration used by the `deploy` utility. Each configuration lists the `oem.components` to be deployed and any overwrites (`customizations`) to be applied. All files will be compiled and minified in order and written to the `deploy` folder in a folder named after the entry. Example: `node oem deploy custom-site.com` will run the "custom-site.com" deployment and produce the following:

- ./deploy/custom-site.com/

    - oem.js
    - oem.min.js
    - oem.min.js.map

## Pattern Library
A pattern library is generated each time a deployment is run. It can be viewed at 

    ./deploy/custom-size.com/pattern-libary
